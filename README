Simple Factory VS Factory method

Simple Factory method separates object creation logic to Factory (creator) class,
in other words, Factory class decides which object to instantiate based on simple criteria.
While Factory method delegates object creation logic to subclasses of creator class, thus those
subclasses are responsible for deciding which object to instantiate (subclasses provides the actual instance).
